            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p class="article-text">
                X-BOW is a local multiplayer PvP game, taking inspiration from <em>Towerfall Ascension</em> and 
                <em>Nuclear Throne</em>. It is my fifth Unity project and first original game. It took roughly 35+ 
                days to complete.

            <h1>Early Development</h1>
            <p class="article-text">
                X-BOW started as a GameMaker Studio project that I made for my highschool game design class 
                in 2015 (pictured below). I had been playing a game called <em>Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</em> at 
                the time and found using the crossbow very fun, so I created a little game centered around 
                the mechanic of firing a crossbow. I wasn't capable of programming challenging AI, but in 
                the computer lab it was easy to play with the person next to me, so it became a local 
                multiplayer PvP game.

            <p class="article-text">
                After I started teaching myself real programming in 2022 by recreating Asteroids, Space 
                Invaders, Snake, and Joust, I decided to revisit X-BOW and create a proper game. 
                The first thing I wanted to change was the game's perspective - I didn't like the 
                top down look of the game; I much preferred the top down oblique perspective of games 
                like <em>Nuclear Throne</em> and <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. Secondly, I wanted to add 
                more depth to the combat of the game.
            </p>
            <h1>Game Design</h1>
            <p class="article-text">
                I began redesigning the combat of the game by brainstorming possible mechanics 
                (i.e. dodge rolling, shooting arrows out of midair, arrow catching, arrow reflecting, 
                melee combat, slashing arrows out of midair, "speed shotting" arrows). I had four 
                pillars of design that I followed to decide which mechanics to add to the game: 
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">1. The crossbow is the core mechanic of the game, therefore it should not have too many ways to counter it</p>
            <p class="article-text">2. I wanted to add mechanics that promoted aggression and active playstyles rather than overly defensive or passive ones</p>
            <p class="article-text">3. Mechanics should have multiple uses to create interesting decisions</p>
            <p class="article-text">4. I wanted the additional abilities to have downsides or punish windows</p>
            <p class="article-text">
                Following these four design pillars, I decided on adding a dodge roll and a melee. 
                The dodge roll has invincibility frames for the first half of the dodge, making it an 
                excellent defensive move if timed well. The dodge can also be used to advance / 
                reposition quickly and aggressively. If used incorrectly, however, it will lock you 
                into a predictable movement and make you an easy target.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
                The melee can be used defensively to deflect an arrow away from you to save yourself, or 
                offensively to reflect an arrow back at an enemy. After using your melee, it takes 1 
                second for your dino to recover, providing an ample punish window for your opponents to 
                take advantage of. It also dovetails well with the dodge roll as it can help you close 
                the distance for an aggressive melee kill. Not only can the melee be used for melee kills
                and reflects, but it can also be used for "speed shotting" your own arrows, wherein you 
                fire an arrow and immediately melee speed boost it. You gain a faster arrow, but can't 
                move for the next 1 second, so it is a risky decision.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
                These mechanics combine to create a fast-paced game full of interesting decisions and 
                mind games.
            </p>
            <h1>Map Design</h1>
            <p class="article-text">
                The map order in the level select is in chronological order of when they were developed, 
                so you can easily/visually see the progression of X-BOW's map design for yourself. 
                It started with maps that only had walls in a simple pattern before progressing into 
                experimentation with interesting map gimmicks. Some things that I learned during development
                were: 
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
                1. Placing walls/cover was my primary method of designing the level, so it was easy to 
                fall into the trap of adding too much. I had the urge to fill in the map with cover 
                because that was the part I was actually creating, but empty space is just as important 
                to the gameplay as cover. Some cut early maps were too constrictive and slowed the game 
                down because I saw empty space as something to fill in. I had already hypothesized before
                I started designing levels that too much cover would restrict players and make the game
                less fun, but it still took me a couple of maps to correct my impulse.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
                2. I wanted the player's gameplay mechanics to be relatively simple, so for the game to 
                hold the player's interest, it was up to the levels to put interesting spins on the 
                gameplay loop. Bushes concealed players, dark levels concealed arrows. Portals are 
                great for opening up maps and creating chaos. Arrow traps synergised well with the 
                reflect mechanic. Targets made the levels more dynamic, as did moving platforms. 
                Finally, slippery ice was just fun.
            </p>
