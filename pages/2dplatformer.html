            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p class="article-text">
                2DPlatformer is a short demonstration of various platformer movement mechanics. This game
                began as a side project during the development of X-BOW. I started this project partly 
                as a break from X-BOW, and partly to test out the state pattern and my ability to 
                reproduce platformer mechanics.
            </p>

                The state pattern is a solution to the issue of increasing complexity surrounding an 
                objects state. A state is the current condition of an object and decides the behavior 
                of the object. When an object has numerous states each with different conditions it can 
                quickly turn into a spaghetti of if/else logic. The state pattern suggests that each 
                state should be moved into its own class. The benefits of this approach include: firstly, 
                when the state code is separated it is clearer to read and understand; and secondly, each 
                state's code is self-contained and changes made to one state won't affect another.
